# Sleeping-teaching-assistant-using-therad-synchronization

• This project deals with solving the Sleeping 
Teaching Assistant problem using thread 
synchronization. 

• The implementation involves defining 
approaches to be taken for different scenarios 
as to how Teaching Assistants (TA) and students 
interact with each other. 

• The solution was implemented using POSIX 
threads, mutex-locks, and semaphores for the 
different scenarios
